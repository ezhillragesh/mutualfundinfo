Mutual Fund Search is a web application that allows users to search for mutual fund schemes and view their details. It utilizes a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly interface and fetch data from an API.

## Features

- **Search:** Users can search for mutual fund schemes by typing in the search bar. The application provides instant suggestions based on the user's input, making it easy to find the desired scheme.
